# Image Spectrumizer

![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/jarikomppa/img2spec/master/img2spec2.jpg)

This is a GUI tool to help convert normal images suitable to be used in ZX Spectrum (and similar devices).
Note that the resolution is 256x192. Feeding the tool smaller or bigger images works, but the internal
image size remains the same.

Instead of trying to be completely automated, this tool lets you interactively adjust the source image
while letting you see the results in real time. Any number of modifiers can be stacked on top of each other,
and their order can be changed.

Output can be saved as a PNG, or in raw, C header, or assembler include file.
